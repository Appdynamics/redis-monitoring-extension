# Redis Monitoring Extension for AppDynamics
 
Redis is an in memory key-value data store used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

The Redis monitoring extension can monitor multiple Redis servers and display the statistics in AppDynamics Metric Browser.
